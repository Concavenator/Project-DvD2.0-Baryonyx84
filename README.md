# DvD2.0

In this project, 2 squares bounce around the screen akin to the DvD logo; however with this you can ajust them as you go along in the following ways:

* The colour of each square may be changed with a dropdown menu
* The size of any square may be changed to any number between 0 and 10
* The speed can also be changed to any number between 0 and 10
* you can check off whether the squares leave behind a trail or not

***Have fun***
